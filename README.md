dygraphs-bower (Deprecated)
==============
Unofficial bower repo for dygraphs (JavaScript charting library): https://github.com/danvk/dygraphs

# Deprecation Warning
**Please don't use this repo.** Use dygraphs bower repo (https://github.com/danvk/dygraphs) as it already contains compiled file.
This repo will be removed soon and dygraphs-bower deregistered from bower.

# Why this repo?
Dygraphs repo doesn't contain compiled and/or minified js file and I don't really want to run their building script as part of my building process nor to fetch the recent version from their server. I created this repo and registered is as a bower package for myself to use, as a temporary solution. 

# Bower install
```
bower install dygraphs-bower
```
