dygraphs-bower
==============

Unofficial bower repo for dygraphs (JavaScript charting library): https://github.com/danvk/dygraphs

# Why this repo?
Dygraphs repo doesn't contain compiled and/or minified js file and I don't really want to run their building script as part of my building process nor to fetch the recent version from their server. I created this repo and registered is as a bower package for myself to use, as a temporary solution. 

# Bower install
```
bower install dygraphs-bower
```
